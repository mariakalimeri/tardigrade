Hi there, 

I am Maria and I use R to build data analysis tools. I am based in Helsinki, Finland, and I work in Nightingale Health, a biotech company specializing in blood biomarker analysis.
 
In the past, I have done research in the fields of protein dynamics, quantitative linguistics and preseismic electromagnetics.
