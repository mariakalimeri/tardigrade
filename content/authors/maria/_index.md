Hi there, 

I am Maria and I am passionate about building data analysis tools. I am based in Helsinki, 
Finland, and I work in Nightingale Health, a biotech company specializing in 
blood biomarker analysis.
 
In the past, I have done research in the fields of protein dynamics, 
quantitative linguistics and preseismic electromagnetics (fields which may sound
diverse but they do share common challenges, at least from the computational 
point of view).

I built this website using blogdown and Hugo and in the photo on the left I am 
sitting in a forest somewhere in central Finland.
