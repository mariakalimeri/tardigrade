Hi there, 

I am Maria and I am passionate about machine learning and building data 
analysis tools. I am based in Helsinki, Finland, and I work at 
[Elisa](https://elisa.com/corporate/?_ga=2.187510955.2038295084.1645975413-1291628732.1640767894), a Finnish telecommunications company.
 
In the past, I have done research in academia in various fields, ranging 
from *in silico* experiments of protein dynamics, through quantitative 
linguistics and NLP, to preseismic electromagnetics. 

I built this website using the [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) 
R package and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and in the photo on the left I am 
sitting in a forest somewhere in central Finland.
