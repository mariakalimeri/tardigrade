This is a post that comes more than a year late but, as they say, better late 
than never. 

I have now been proudly working for 
[Nightingale](https://nightingalehealth.com/) for more than 3 years. It's been 
a place that combines intellectual curiosity and coziness (usually 
found in academia - or well, a startup) with a great teamwork energy. 
Nightingale is a Finnish biotech, scale-up company that has developed a 
biomarker analysis platform using NMR technology. Having offered the service 
for more than 7 years now to epidemiology research groups, the vision is to 
bring the technology to everyone, in the form of individual testing, providing
insight in ones own metabolic health and that way helping them prevent chronic 
diseases. (Have a look [here for Nightingale's blood test](https://nightingalehealth.com/my-nightingale)!)

Scientific research lies at the very core of Nightingale. This bit certainly 
played it's role for me, when moving from academia to a company, three years ago. 
Faithful to its values, last year Nightingale offered some of it's data 
visualization and analysis machinery to the broad audience. `ggforestplot` is an
R package to visualize efficiently different types of association results. 

You can access the tool, tutorials and functions [here](https://nightingalehealth.github.io/ggforestplot/index.html).
