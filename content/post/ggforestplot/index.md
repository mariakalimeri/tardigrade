I have now been proudly working for 
[Nightingale Health](https://nightingalehealth.com/) for more than 3 years. It's been 
a place that combines intellectual curiosity and coziness (usually 
found in academia - or well, a startup) with a great teamwork energy. 
Nightingale is a Finnish biotech, scale-up company that has developed a 
biomarker analysis platform using NMR technology. Having offered the service 
to epidemiology research groups for more than 7 years now, the vision is to 
bring the technology to everyone, in the form of individual testing, providing
insight in one's own metabolic health and that way helping people prevent chronic 
diseases. (Have a look [here for Nightingale's blood test](https://nightingalehealth.com/my-nightingale)!)

Scientific research lies at the very core of Nightingale. This bit certainly 
played its role for me, when moving from academia to a company, three years ago. 
Faithful to its values, last year Nightingale offered some of its data 
visualization and analysis machinery to the broad audience. `ggforestplot` is an
R package to visualize efficiently different types of association results. 
You can access the tool, tutorials and functions [here](https://nightingalehealth.github.io/ggforestplot/index.html).

Open source and R FTW! I really enjoy using R and I must admit that I actually 
(re)discovered it in Nightingale. I have the great - let's call it - luck
to work closely with a team of more than ten highly skilled data scientists and 
engineers, that compliment each other in harmony. It's there I got the chance 
to learn how to build reusable tools and enjoy this unique feeling of fulfillment 
this gives you afterwards.
