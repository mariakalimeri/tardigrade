abstract: Membrane phosphoinositides have emerged as key regulators of the actin 
  cytoskeleton in cell migration, morphogenesis, cytokinesis, and endocytosis. 
  However, the molecular mechanisms by which actin-binding proteins (ABPs) 
  interact with phosphoinositide-rich membranes remain remarkably poorly 
  understood. By applying a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and 
  atomistic molecular dynamics simulation approaches on six central ABPs, we 
  discovered that they employ multivalent electrostatic interactions for 
  membrane binding. Strikingly, our experiments revealed that these proteins 
  display enormous differences in their membrane interaction dynamics and in 
  the ranges of phosphoinositide densities that they sense. These differences 
  precisely correlate with the specific functions of these proteins in 
  cytoskeletal dynamics. These findings uncover molecular principles by which 
  membrane phosphoinositides regulate dynamics and architecture of the actin 
  cytoskeleton in cells.
